### Description

This is a simple program for organizing recipes. To begin, add a collection of recipes. When you later need to look one up, simply run the program, search your database of recipes for the recipe you want, and you can print out a copy of the recipe. The program can list recipes beginning with a letter you specify, or any string of text, or you can search within the text of the recipe for a word or phrase you are looking for.

The interface is very simple and easy to use.

Enjoy!
